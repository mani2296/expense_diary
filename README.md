# expense_diary
In this small project user can add day to day expense and it will inserted into mysql database. The user can query the list of expenses he made. There is another one important feature where user can know per day what is the overall amount he had spent. For this i will be using sqoop to import the data into hdfs and using hive i can do aggregation on per day basis and export the result back to mysql database using sqoop which can be queried by user. This is like an end to end ETL process. you can schdule the job so that this ETL process will run for fixed interval of time.
